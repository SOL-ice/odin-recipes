   <h2>100k for a jpeg ape?</h2>

   <p>I know many of you are confused as to who would ever pay such an amount for a picture of an ape on the internet, and trust me it's a lot.
       But there is more to it than just the jpeg of an ape it's the exclusivity of owning that NFT (ape) and kind of luxourius in a way to have
       it as your profile picture.
   </p>

   <p>By owning this non fungible token it is unique and once you purchase it it's yours and it will have this unique address in which will identify
       the NFT and is proof and validated by that unique address. By owning this NFT you also get exclusive access to chats, events and alpha calls on
       potential investment opporunities.
